/*The child element will have a width equal to 50% of the parent element with a padding of 20 pixels. 
Note that padding: 20px is shorthand for setting the padding top, bottom, left and right to 20px.
To visualize the space it occupies, set the border to greenTo align the element to the center,
set its margin property to auto. 
The auto will tell the browser to calculate the margin automatically based on the space available*/

 This allows you to set the top and bottom margins to specific values if needed*/

/*The two most common ways to left and right align elements are to use
 the float property and the position property.
The position property has several value options that impact how the element displays in the document flow. 
You'll explore how to use the position property later on. For now, let's focus on the float property*/
