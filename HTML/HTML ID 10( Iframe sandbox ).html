IFRAME
An iframe is HTML element that allows you to place or embed content 
from another website into a webpage. It's defined using the iframe HTML tag. 
How it works is that it embeds another browsing instance inside the page.

ALLOW
It specifies what features or permissions are available to the frame, 
for instance, access to the microphone, camera, other APIs and so on. For example: 
allow="fullscreen” the fullscreen mode can be activated 
allow=“geolocation” lets you access the user's location 
To specify more than one feature, a semicolon-separator should be used between features.
<iframe src="https://example.com/…" allow="camera; microphone"> </iframe> 

NAME 
The name for the <!--<iframe>-->. For example: 
<iframe name = "My Frame" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

HEIGHT
It specifies the height of the frame. The default value is 150, in terms of CSS pixels. 

WIDTH
Specifies the width of the frame, in terms of CSS pixels. The default value is 300 pixels.

REFERRERPOLICY
A referrer is the HTTP header that lets the page know who is loading it. 
This attribute indicates which referrer information to send when loading the frame resource. 
The common values are: 
* 'no-referrer': The referrer header will not be sent. 
* 'origin': The referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page. 
* 'strict-origin': The origin of the document is sent as the referrer only 
   when using the same protocol security level (HTTPS to HTTPS).

SANDBOX
To enforce greater security, a sandbox applies extra restrictions to the content in the <!--<iframe>-->.
(permission token) is used to lift restrictions,some common token include
'allow-downloads': Allows the user to download an item 
'allow-forms': Allows the user to submit forms 
'allow-modals': The resource can open modal windows 
'allow-orientation-lock': Lets the resource lock the screen orientation 
'allow-popups Allows': popups to open 
'allow-presentation': Allows a presentation session to start 
'allow-scripts': Lets the resource run scripts without creating popup windows
<iframe src="my_iframe_sandbox.html" sandbox="allow-forms allow-scripts"> 
</iframe>
if (sandbox ="") that means all permisions are restricted

SRC
The URL of the page to embed in the <!--<iframe>-->. 
Using the value about:blank would embed an empty page.

srcdoc
Let's you specify the inline HTML to embed in the <!--<iframe>-->. 
When defined, this attribute would override the src attribute.  
For instance, the following code will display "My inline html" 
in the frame, instead of loading my_iframe_src.html. 
<iframe src="my_iframe_src.html" srcdoc= "<p>My inline html</p>" > 
</iframe> 

This attribute let's you specify if the iframe should be loaded immediately when 
the web page loads (eager) or loaded when iframe is displayed in the browser (lazy).
<iframe src="my_iframe_src.html" loading="lazy" > 
</iframe> 

TITLE
This attribute let's you add a description to the iframe for accessibility purposes. 
The value of this attribute should accurately describe the iframe's content.
<iframe src="history.html" title="An embedded document about the history of my family" > 
</iframe> 


<!--The little lemon restaurant wants to add an image to promote another restaurant meal
     we use the sandbox element to prevent any javascript code from running in the background -->
<!--We use allow attribute to disable the payment, microphone, and camera access. -->
    <iframe src="Pasta Salad.jpeg" sandbox="" width="320" height="128" allow="payment 'none';camera 'none';microphone 'none'"> 
    </iframe>
