        <li>Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, 
            focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. </li> 

        <li>The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 
            12-15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere 
            with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.</li> 

        <li>Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the 
            United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, 
            Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.</li>
