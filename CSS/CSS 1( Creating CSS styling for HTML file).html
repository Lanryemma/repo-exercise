        <!--This next example is the Child selector 
        (also a type of decendant selector but it specifies the <div> tag)
        This will select the element with the ID blog (the parent), 
        then it will select all h1 elements that are contained directly in that element (the children). 
        The structure of the child selector is a CSS selector 
        followed by the child combinator symbol > followed by another CSS selector-->
                <div id="blog1">
                    <h1>Latest News1</h1>

        <!--This next example is the hover pseudo-class.
            The simplest example of this is changing the color of a hyperlink when it is hovered over. 
            To do this, you add the :hover pseudo-class to the end of the selector. In the following example, 
            adding :hover  to the a element will change the color of the hyperlink to orange when it is hovered over.
            The css code will look like this a:hover {
                                                         color: orange;
                                                        }-->
